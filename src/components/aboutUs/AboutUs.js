                    It all started with a love for functional programming.
                    Scalac was established in 2014 in Gdansk, Poland. The
                    company was founded by passionate software developers Lukas,
                    Jakub, and Patryk who were using the Scala programming
                    language. Scala was the perfect solution to their problems
                    as Enterprise Java programmers.

                    Their goal was to resolve the challenges of companies that
                    wanted to scale fast, but couldn’t due to the challenges of
                    hiring skilled developers fast. Back then, Scala was
                    relatively new, and the demand for talent among passionate
                    CTO’s was growing. So ScalaC was born as an answer to this
                    need.
